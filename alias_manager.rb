# Create a method that will change a user's name 
	# input: name (string)

# For every vowel in the name, it will be switched the to next vowel in the line (ex: E will become I, O will become U)
# For the first name and last name, it will swap them.
	# If there is a middle name, it will remain in the middle 
# For each constant in the name it will be the next constant in the alphabet
