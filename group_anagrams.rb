# Pseudocode 
# -------------------------------------------

# Given an array of strings, group anagrams together. 

# Create a method that will take the array
	# input: array 
	# out put: 2D array 

# Create a loop that will match the first word with the next anagram. Once they are grouped together, shove them into an array. Repeat until the end of the original array.
