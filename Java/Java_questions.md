# Java Questions

1. What does Java SE Development Kit(JDK) do? Why is it needed? 
2. What is Notepad++?

	- It supports several programming languages and features syntax highlighting, syntax folding, PCRE (Perl Compatible Regular Expression) search/replace, auto-completion, multi-document editing, WYSIWYG printing, zoom in and zoom out, bookmarks, macro recording and playback, and more.
	- Notepad++ is free and open source, first released in 2003 by Don Ho. It’s written in C++ and based on powerful editing component Scintilla. This free open source library supports many features to make code editing easier in addition to error indicators, line numbering in the margin, as well as line markers such as code breakpoints. 
3. Why Is Notepad++ Mac Not Available?

	- Notepad++ relies extensively on Win32 API, the 32-bit application programming interface for modern versions of Windows. Win32 API consists of many components, including things like file systems, devices, processes, threads, and error handling. It’s also responsible for that instantly recognizable Windows look and feel that many long-term users of the operating system find so appealing. In short, without Win32 API, there’s no Notepad++. At least not without a major rewriting of the application...Porting Notepad++ to another operating system would also break the compatibility with most plugins, essentially fragmenting the Notepad++ community.
4. What does IntelliJ IDEA mean? 
	[link for info on IntelliJ](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/7755/intellij-idea)
	-IntelliJ IDEA is a special programming environment or integrated development environment (IDE) largely meant for Java. This environment is used especially for the development of programs. It is developed by a company called JetBrains, which was formally called IntelliJ. It is available in two editions: the Community Edition which is licensed by Apache 2.0, and a commercial edition known as the Ultimate Edition. Both of them can be used for creating software which can be sold. What makes IntelliJ IDEA so different from its counterparts is its ease of use, flexibility and its solid design....The biggest reason it is regarded as one of the best programming tools based on Java is its assistance features, which makes it easy to use and makes the programs created by it very well designed. It also has advanced error checking features which allows faster and easier error checking.	
5. Why configure the JDK to persist by adding the last command to ~/.profile file?
