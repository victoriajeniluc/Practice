# Java Notes 

	## IntelliJ 
	 * Using IntelliJ, it will automatically create a public class for you!  
	 * Using VCS allows me to push, pull, commit changes with my Github by using the terminal on it. 
		- Use the VCS Pop up to do that stuff! 

	[picture of JVM, JRE, JDK](JDK,JVM,JRE.png)	
	 * JVM aka Java Virtual Machine  
		- runs the Java bytecode. 
		- understand java grammar and syntax; therefore, we have to complie our java programs to generate the bytecode and JVM understands these bytecode
	 * JRE aka Java runtime environment 
		- provides the JVM, libraries, and other tools to run 
	 * JDK aka Java Development Kit 
		- the superset of JRE and contains everything that is in the JRE plus tools such as the compiler and debugger; **necessary developing java applications**!!

	## Files in Program 
		* src folder is where you save all the java files 

	## SYNTAX 
	* Semicolon must be at the end for every line in java 


## SHORTCUT 
	* sout + tab will type out System.out.println("Hello World");
