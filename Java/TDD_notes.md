##What is TDD?## 
* The triangle: 
	1. Red
		* Writing a failing test, run it, and make sure it goes red / fails correctly 
	2. Green 
		* Making the test pass by writing the code 
	3. Refactor 
		* Cleaning the code to make it more D RY

##STEPS:## 
* How to write TDD: 
	1. Test the simpliest thing you can 
		* Mostly testing that nothing happens 
	2. Once you watch it fail, write the simplest code you can to make the test pass 
		* DO NOT IMPLEMENT A WHOLE SOLUTION... just enough for the test to go green 
	3. Once you have the green test, if your code quality can improve... you should refactor 
		* REFACTOR THE TEST CODE OR THE PRODUCTION CODE - NEVER BOTH
